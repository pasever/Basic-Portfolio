				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div id="bioHrLine"></div>
				<img id="profilePicture" src="assets/images/Evgheni_Pascalov.jpg" alt="Evgheni Pascalov" >
				
				<p>Just six month ago I was sitting in the lobby of Wake Forest University, waiting for my MBA interview. That is what I had to do. You go to college, you find a great job soon after. Couple of years later, you go to get your Masters and you end up even with better job. And all this is great, if you know you were on the right path from the very beginning. But that was not me.</p>
				
				<p>I think becoming a web developer (at least on a way of becoming) its been the biggest and most important step in my life. And it was the right step. I got my Bachelors degree in Finance and Economics but never learn how to paint. Programing made me a Van Gogh.  </p>
				
				<p>So, currently I am attending the Boot Camp at University of North Carolina in Charlotte and I am loving in it. I love the city, love the College, love the professors and can not wait to see what is next. And by the way, the MBA interview went well.</p>
				<p>Couple of fun facts about me: - I played basketball for the Junior National team back in Europe - Before I started the boot camp I spoke 4 languages. I would love to find out  how many I am going to learn by the end of the program.</p>
